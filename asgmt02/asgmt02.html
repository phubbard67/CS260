<h1 class="title">CS260 Assignment 2</h1>
<h2 class="header">Instructions</h2>
<!-- InstanceBeginEditable name="description" -->
<p>In this assignment, you will implement a &ldquo;quack,&rdquo; which is the result of cross-breeding a queue and a stack.</p>
<p>Your implementation of the <span class="code">Quack</span> class will store its items as a <em>circular array</em> (you can find a description of this concept in the textbook). Your array should be <span style="font-style: italic">dynamically allocated</span>. The number of array elements should be as specified by the <span class="code">capacity</span> argument of the <span class="code">Quack</span> constructor.</p>
<p>The point of a circular array is that very few array elements need to be moved from their first location in the array to other locations. Each of the functions in your code is required to move the minimum possible number of array elements.</p>
<p>Your code will need to allow the circular array to become &ldquo;full&rdquo; (i.e. every slot contains a valid item). Your Quack instance should keep track of when the array is full by remembering the size of the array and  the current number of items it contains.</p>
<p>Your implementation of the <span class="code">rotate</span> and <span class="code">reverse</span> member functions should operate directly on the circular array within the function itself, and not make <span style="font-style: italic">any</span> calls to <span class="code">popFront</span>, <span class="code">pushBack</span>, etc. Your <span class="code">rotate</span> function should take advantage of the properties of a circular array to move as few elements of the array as possible.</p>
<p>You are required to mplement <span class="code">rotate</span> and <span class="code">reverse</span> to work <span style="font-style: italic">in place</span> in the array pointed to by the <span class="code">items</span> data member. &ldquo;In place&rdquo; means in the original array, without using any other array. The only array variable you are allowed to use in these functions is the <span class="code">items</span> data member itself.</p>
<p>You should store the <em>first</em> item you add to the quack in array location 0. Items pushed onto the <em>back</em> should be stored in increasing locations (&ldquo;increasing&rdquo; means in the direction of higher indices). Items pushed onto the <em>front</em> should be stored in decreasing locations. This means that if the quack is initially empty and the first two items are added via <span class="code">pushFront</span>, the first one will go into <span class="code">items[0]</span>, and the second one will go into <span class="code">items[sizeOfArray &ndash; 1]</span>.</p>
<p>The driver produces a file named <strong>array.txt</strong>, which shows where each item is stored in the assignment. Your code will need to produce an <strong>array.txt </strong>whose contents match one of the provided files depending on which version of the assignment you choose to do.</p>
<p>There are additional instructions in comments in the code files.</p>
<p><!-- #BeginLibraryItem "/Library/regular vs. premium.lbi" --> <span style="font-style: italic">This assignment comes in two versions: <strong><!-- #BeginLibraryItem "/Library/regular.lbi" -->Regular<!-- #EndLibraryItem --></strong> (which is easier) and <strong><!-- #BeginLibraryItem "/Library/premium.lbi" -->Premium<!-- #EndLibraryItem --></strong> (which is more difficult). If you want to get an A in this course, you will need to do the Premium version. If, instead, you will be satisfied with a B, you can do the Regular version and save yourself some work. </span><!-- #EndLibraryItem --></p>
<hr />
<h2 class="header">Regular Version </h2>
<p><!-- #BeginLibraryItem "/Library/array size rquirement.lbi" -->The array should initially be <em>exactly</em> the size specified in the <span class="code">capacity</span> argument of the <span class="code">Quack</span> constructor.<!-- #EndLibraryItem --> Once it&rsquo;s full, The <span class="code">Quack</span> should refuse to accept new items.</p>
<p>Leave <span class="code">Quack::PREMIUM_VERSION</span> set to <span class="code">false</span>.</p>
<p>Your code needs to produce output that&rsquo;s identical to the contents of <strong>asgmt02.regular.correctOutput.txt</strong> (except for minor differences in whitespace). Your <strong>array.txt</strong> file should be identical to <strong>array.regular.txt</strong>.</p>
<hr />
<h2 class="header">Premium  Version</h2>
<p>In this version, when the array is full and a new item is added, it will need to grow. It should grow by the number of slots specified in the <span class="code">growBy</span> argument to the <span class="code">Quack</span> constructor.</p>
<p><!-- #BeginLibraryItem "/Library/array size rquirement.lbi" -->The array should initially be <em>exactly</em> the size specified in the <span class="code">capacity</span> argument of the <span class="code">Quack</span> constructor.<!-- #EndLibraryItem --> The array should grow <em>dynamically</em> (i.e. only when it needs to because it&rsquo;s adding a new item and there are no more empty slots). When it grows, the array should grow by <em>exactly </em>the  number of slots specified in the growBy argument of the <span class="code">Quack</span> constructor.</p>
<p>Set <span class="code">Quack::PREMIUM_VERSION</span> to <span class="code">true</span>.</p>
<p>Your code needs to produce output that&rsquo;s identical to the contents of <strong>asgmt02.premium.correctOutput.txt</strong> (except for minor differences in whitespace). Your <strong>array.txt</strong> file should be identical to <strong>array.premium.txt</strong>.</p>
<hr />
<!-- InstanceEndEditable -->
<h2 class="header">Code To Start With </h2>
<p>The code for you to start with is in <span class="code"><!-- #BeginLibraryItem "/Library/as01 mlt cs260 asgmts directory.lbi" --> ~michael.trigoboff/cs260/asgmts<!-- #EndLibraryItem -->/asgmt02</span>. </p>
<p>Add code to the definition and implementation files as needed. You can add public and private members, but <span style="font-style: italic">do not remove any of the public members that are already there</span>. Also, <span style="font-style: italic">make no changes </span>to <span class="code" style="font-weight: bold">asgmt0<strong>2</strong>.cpp</span>.</p>
<p>There may be additional instructions in comments in the code files, which may contradict these instructions. In that case, do what the instructions in the code say you should do.</p>
<h2 class="header">Required Submission File Structure</h2>
<p>You are required to submit your work as a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tar_%28computing%29" target="_blank">Linux tarball</a>. No other file format is acceptable. Use<span class="code"><!-- #BeginLibraryItem "/Library/as01 mlt home directory.lbi" -->
~michael.trigoboff<!-- #EndLibraryItem -->/bin/tarz</span> to create your tarball.</p>
<p>Do not change the structure of your project directory in any way. Do not rename files, add new files, or delete files. I grade your code using a Bash script that depends on files being in predictable places. Nothing in this assignment requires files to be moved, renamed, deleted, etc.<br />
</p>
<p class="header">Strings</p>
<p>For storing and printing strings, you should use <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CString" target="_blank">C strings</a>. Your code should<span class="code"> #include &lt;cstring&gt;</span> and use the functions defined in that header, such as:</p>
<ul>
  <li class="code">int strlen(char *str)<br />
  // given a string pointer, returns the length of that string,<br />
  // 
  which does not include the terminating '\0' character</li>
  <li class="code">void strcpy(char *dst, char *src)<br />
    // copies the characters in src to dst,<br />
    //
  including the terminating '\0' character</li>
</ul>
<h2 class="header">Printed Output</h2>
<p>Your code&rsquo;s printed output needs to be identical to the contents of the &ldquo;correct output&rdquo; file(s)  provided as part of this assignment. &ldquo;Identical&rdquo; means the Linux utility <span class = "code">diff</span> will find no differences between your code&rsquo;s output and the provided file, when called with flags: <span class="code">-w -B</span>. This means that the sequence of non-whitespace characters in your output has to be identical, but that differences in whitespace will be ignored.</p>
<p>You are still required to produce output that lines up with itself properly. Columns may need to line up, numbers may need to be right-justified,  etc. You should look at the &ldquo;correct output&rdquo; file(s) to see what you need to do.</p>
<h2 class="header">Memory Leaks</h2>
<p>Your code is required to run without memory leaks. You should use <span class="code"><!-- #BeginLibraryItem "/Library/as01 mlt home directory.lbi" --> ~michael.trigoboff<!-- #EndLibraryItem -->/bin/mchk</span> to check this.</p>
<h2 class="header">Initialization Lists </h2>
<p>The constructors in your code should use an <a href="http://www.learncpp.com/cpp-tutorial/101-constructor-initialization-lists/" target="_blank">initialization list</a> item for <em>each</em> data member defined by the class. Points will be deducted where this is not done.</p>
<p>Here is a class definition:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre class="code">
class SomeClass
{
    ...

private:
    int     dataMember1;
    int     dataMember2;
}</pre></blockquote>
<p>Here is a constructor for this class that does not use an initialization list:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre class="code">
SomeClass::SomeClass(int dataMember1, int dataMember2)
{
    this->dataMember1 = dataMember1;
    this->dataMember2 = dataMember2;
}</pre></blockquote>
<p>And here is one that does use an initialization list: </p>
<blockquote>
<pre class="code">
SomeClass::SomeClass(int dataMember1, int dataMember2) :
    dataMember1{dataMember1},
    dataMember2{dataMember2}
{
}</pre></blockquote>
<p>An initialization list consists of comma-separated items between the <strong class="code">:</strong> and the <strong class="code">{</strong> that begins the body of the function. Each of these items is of the form:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre class="code">
dataMemberName{value}</pre></blockquote>
<p>Each item sets the named data member to the value in the parentheses. In the SomeClass constructor above, each of the two initialization list items sets its data member to the constructor argument named inside the parentheses. This is weird-looking syntax, but it is standard usage in the culture of C++. </p>
<h2 class="header">Grading Your Code</h2>
<p>Your code needs to compile without errors or warnings and run correctly. Code that does not compile will receive zero points. Code that crashes will receive zero points.</p>
<p>I use Bash scripts to grade your code. Because of this, it is very important that you not make any changes to file names or the folder structure in your project. Your project should have all the same names in all the same places as the starter project you copied from <span class="code"><!-- #BeginLibraryItem "/Library/as01 mlt cs260 asgmts directory.lbi" -->
 ~michael.trigoboff/cs260/asgmts<!-- #EndLibraryItem -->/asgmt02</span>. If you change any of this, my scripts will crash. Your work will not be graded, you will have to resubmit a corrected version of your work, and you will lose points.</p>
<p>My scripts produce a log file containing your code, compiler warnings and errors (if any), your code's output, and some statistics that are useful to me. I then personally go through that log file to produce your grade. In other words, the script doesn't decide your grade, it just makes it more convenient for me to decide your grade.</p>
<h2 class="header">To Submit This Assignment</h2>
<p>Remove anything like calls to <span class="code">cin.get()</span>, that would stop your code.</p>
<p>Then &ldquo;clean&rdquo; your project by doing the following:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p class="code"> make x</p>
</blockquote>
<p>After cleaning your project, compress it into a tarball, <span class="code">asgmt02.tar.gz</span> using <span class="code"><!-- #BeginLibraryItem "/Library/as01 mlt home directory.lbi" --> ~michael.trigoboff<!-- #EndLibraryItem -->/bin/tarz</span>. Submit the tarball containing your cleaned project to Desire2Learn.</p>
<p>Please be sure the source file prints your name, assignment description and number, as requested.</p>
<p>You may upload as many versions as you wish prior to the due date. I will only see and grade the last one. You won't be able to upload assignments after the due date.</p>
